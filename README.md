# SSH tunnels

This package lets you run and kill SSH tunnels.  To use it:

- Set the variable `ssh-tunnels-configurations`, e.g.:

```emacs-lisp
(setq ssh-tunnels-configurations
      '((:name "my local tunnel"
         :local-port 1234
         :remote-port 3306
         :login "me@host")
        (:name "my remote tunnel"
         :type "-R"
         :local-port 1234
         :remote-port 3306
         :login "me@host")
        (:name "my local socket tunnel"
         :type "-L"
         :local-socket "/tmp/socket"
         :remote-socket "/tmp/socket"
         :login "me@host")))
```

- Type `M-x ssh-tunnels RET`

- You should see the list of tunnels; running tunnels will have 'R'
  in their state column

- To run the tunnel at the current line, type `r`

- To kill a running tunnel, type `k`

- You may want to temporarily change a tunnel's local port.  To do
  that you may provide a prefix argument to the run command, for
  example by typing `C-u 1235 r`

## Helm, Ido, Ivy

The package comes with a Helm frontend (`M-x helm-ssh-tunnels`) as
well as `completing-read` frontends, which can be used with Ido or Ivy
(`M-x ssh-tunnels-run-tunnel` and `M-x ssh-tunnels-kill-tunnel`).

## Auto-ssh-tunnels-mode

This package also includes a global minor-mode that automatically
starts SSH tunnels when Emacs's built-in `open-network-stream`
function is used.  Before a connection is made to a host and port that
correspond to a tunnel's host and local port, this mode will make sure
that the tunnel is running.

Use `M-x auto-ssh-tunnels-mode` to enable this global minor-mode.
